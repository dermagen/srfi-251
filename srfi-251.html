<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Scheme has traditionally required procedure bodies and the bodies of derived constructs 
such as <code>let</code> to contain definitions followed by commands/expressions. 
This SRFI proposes to allow mixing commands and groups of definitions in such bodies, so that each
command/expression is in the scope of all local definitions preceding it, but not in scope of 
the local definitions following it. This approach is backwards compatible with R7RS and 
upholds the intuitive rule that to find the definition of a lexical variable, one has 
to look <em>up</em> the source code tree.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None known at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>
This SRFI competes with Daphne Preston-Kendal's <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-245/">SRFI-245</a>,
which also allows arbitrary mixing of expressions/commands with definitions within single &langle;body&rangle;.
The difference is in the <em>scope</em> of the internal definitions &mdash; while SRFI-245 proposes single recursive
scope for all definitions, this SRFI limits the scope of each group of immediately adjacent definitions to the 
corresponding initializers and the subsequent body forms; the preceding body forms are not included. This 
scope rule is in line with common expectations on identifier visibility: to find a definition of an identifier,
one has to go <em>up</em> the source tree, looking at groups of adjacent definitions, bindings, or formals; the
first definition found (or top-level one if none is found) is the definition for the identifier in question.
SRFI-245's rule of looking not only <em>up</em> the tree, but also <em>down</em>, stepping over the commands
until the whole body is inspected, goes against the usual expectations. The proposed approach to scopes within
body-like constructs with mixed expressions and definitions is in line with decisions made by designers of
modern functional languages such as ReasonML, Elixir, and others. 
</p>

<p>
Note that differences in scope behavior of the proposed body-level definitions and top-level definitions
are made necessary by the fact that potentially there is a lot of lexically-scoped identifiers to refer
to from bodies, while top level has just one scope, the program/library global scope. The “look up the tree” 
rule for searching for variable definitions is not applicable on the top level, because there is no “up”;
replicating this functionality on a local level may lead to hard-to-follow code, with “up” and “down”
variable definition scans competing for programmer's attention (this is why bindings-first <code>let</code>-style
forms are usually preferred to bindings-at-end <code>where</code>-style forms).
</p>
  
<p>
The rationale for allowing commands before and between the definitions within a single &langle;body&rangle;
is the same as in SRFI-245, so it is copied verbatim below (except for the last paragraph). Also, since this 
proposal requires body-level <code>begin</code> forms to be treated as purely splicing constructs, implementation
of some definition-producing macros such as <code>define-values</code> can become easier because they can 
expand to a command or a <code>begin</code> form with a mix of commands and definitions so it can be used not 
only on the top level, but also locally, on a body level. 
</p>

<p>
It often makes sense to run type and other basic error checks on input forms before any other code runs 
(including the right-hand sides of definitions):
</p>
<pre><code>(define (double-square x) 
  (unless (number? x)
    (error "foo: not a number" x))
  (define y (square x))
  (* 2 y))
</code></pre>

<p>
It is likewise sometimes useful to insert logging code before the beginning of a procedure before any other code:
</p>

<pre><code>(define (dangerous-operation x)
  (log-warn "Beginning dangerous operation on value" x)
  (define prepared-x (prepare-for-dangerous-operation x))
  ...)
</code></pre>

<p>
  When writing test suites it is often beneficial to build up values to be tested and run the tests on them incrementally:
</p>

<pre><code>(test-group "basic arithmetic"
  (define one-plus-one (+ 1 1))
  (test 2 one-plus-one)
  (define two-plus-two (+ one-plus-one one-plus-one))
  (test 4 two-plus-two))</code></pre>
      
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>
Scheme's syntax for &langle;body&rangle; must be changed to
allow &langle;definition&rangle; at any top-level position but the last.
The grammar rules are:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&langle;body&rangle; &xrarr; &langle;command&rangle; &langle;body&rangle;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&langle;definition&rangle;<small>+</small> &langle;body&rangle;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&langle;expression&rangle;<br>
</p>

<p>
Informally, each group of adjacent definitions starts a new mutually recursive scope 
that incorporates the rest of the body. More formally, we can represent the semantics of
new &langle;body&rangle; in terms of R7RS &langle;body&rangle; via translation function 
T[<i>new body</i>] &xrArr; <i>R7RS body</i> : 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T[&langle;command&rangle; &langle;body&rangle;]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&xrArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&langle;command&rangle; T[&langle;body&rangle;]<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T[&langle;definition&rangle;<small>+</small> &langle;body&rangle;]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&xrArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>((lambda</code> <code>()</code> &langle;definition&rangle;<small>+</small> T[&langle;body&rangle;]<code>))</code><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T[&langle;expression&rangle;]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&xrArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&langle;expression&rangle;<br/>
</p>

<p>
A conforming implementation must allow body-level definitions of the form 
<code>(begin</code> &langle;definition&rangle;<small>+</small><code>)</code> to contain
an arbitrary mix of commands and definitions to be “spliced” into the original body before
the above translation is (conceptually) performed. In effect, this extends the syntax
of body-level <code>begin</code> definitions to that of top/program/library-level <code>begin</code>, 
i.e. <code>(begin</code> &langle;command or definition&rangle;<small>+</small><code>)</code>
</p>

<p>
The actual transformation, ran as a part of the macro expansion process, must ensure that
macro uses expanding into definitions are processed in the same way as forms they expand to.
In order to support this SRFI, the “definition discovery” process, normally limited to initial 
body forms, should be repeated after each non-definition form, producing a new nested recursive 
scope for each group of adjacent definitions. Body-level <code>begin</code> forms, possibly
resulting from macro expansion in scopes established as macro processing steps through the body 
forms, are “spliced in” as soon as they are discovered, by prepending the contained forms to the
list of forms yet to be processed.

Examples:  
</p>

<pre><code>(let ()
  expr_1
  (define var_1 (x))
  expr_2
  expr_3
  (define-syntax mac_1 (syntax-rules () ((_) (y))))
  (define var_2 (z))
  expr_4
  expr_5)
</code></pre>
<p>can be rewritten as (R7RS):</p>	
<pre><code>(let ()
  expr_1
  (let ()
    (define var_1 (x))
    expr_2
    expr_3
    (let ()
      (define-syntax mac_1 (syntax-rules () ((_) (y))))
      (define var_2 (z))
      expr_4
      expr_5)))
</code></pre>
<p>Mix of definitions and syntax definitions:</p>
<pre><code>(let ((x 0) (l '())) 
  (set! x 1) 
  (define-syntax incx (syntax-rules () ((_ v) (set! x (+ x v)))))
  (define (pushv v) (set! l (cons v l)))
  (define-syntax pushx (syntax-rules () ((_) (pushv x))))
  (pushx)
  (define-syntax x (syntax-rules () ((_) 42)))
  (pushx)
  (incx 14)
  (pushx)
  (pushv (x))
  l)
&xrArr;  
(42 15 1 1)
</code></pre>
